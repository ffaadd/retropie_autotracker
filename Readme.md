# A Link to the Past Randomizer Retropie Autotracker Setup

To use an autotracker you have to install serval things and make some configuration changes on your raspberry. This repository includes an `install.sh` which 
downloads the softaware, install it and apply patches where needed.

Clone this Repository on your retropie and run `install.sh`

The autotracker is accessable on `http://retropie:8000` within your home network after the installation an reboot.
